Design Document for Automation Testing with Refection
1. Introduction
1.1 Purpose
This document outlines the design for an automated testing framework using Refection and VBA to create and execute test scripts. Each test case will use a different client account, and the test logs will be generated and stored as .txt files in a designated folder.

1.2 Scope
The scope of this design includes:

Setting up the test environment.
Creating test scripts using VBA.
Executing test cases with different client accounts.
Generating and storing test logs.
1.3 Definitions, Acronyms, and Abbreviations
VBA: Visual Basic for Applications
Refection: The software tool used for test automation
Test Script: A sequence of instructions that automate the execution of test cases
Test Log: A file that records the results of the test execution
2. System Overview
The automated testing framework will consist of the following components:

Test Environment: The setup required to execute the test cases.
Test Scripts: Written in VBA to automate the testing process.
Client Accounts: Different accounts used for testing various scenarios.
Log Storage: A folder where the test logs will be stored as .txt files.
3. Design Considerations
3.1 Assumptions
The Refection software is installed and configured on the test machines.
Client accounts are pre-created and accessible for testing purposes.
3.2 Constraints
Test execution must be performed within the time allocated for each test session.
Logs must be stored securely and accessible for review.
4. Detailed Design
4.1 Test Environment Setup
Refection Installation: Ensure Refection is installed and configured on the test machine.
VBA Setup: Set up the VBA environment for scripting within Refection.
4.2 Test Script Development
Script Structure: Each test script will include:
Initialization of the test environment.
Execution of test steps.
Verification of expected outcomes.
Logging of results.
Sample Script:
vba
Copy code
Sub TestCase1()
    ' Initialize test environment
    Dim clientAccount As String
    clientAccount = "ClientAccount1"
    
    ' Execute test steps
    ' Example: Log in with client account, perform actions, verify results
    
    ' Log results
    Dim logFilePath As String
    logFilePath = "C:\TestLogs\TestCase1_" & Format(Now(), "yyyyMMdd_HHmmss") & ".txt"
    
    Open logFilePath For Output As #1
    Print #1, "Test Case 1"
    Print #1, "Client Account: " & clientAccount
    Print #1, "Result: Pass"
    Close #1
End Sub
4.3 Test Case Execution
Execution Process:
Each test case will be executed using a different client account.
The script will be run within Refection, and results will be logged.
4.4 Log Generation and Storage
Log File Naming Convention: Each log file will be named with the test case identifier and timestamp (e.g., TestCase1_20240725_123456.txt).
Log Storage Location: All log files will be stored in C:\TestLogs\.
5. Testing
5.1 Test Plan
Unit Testing: Verify individual test scripts for correctness.
Integration Testing: Ensure that test scripts work together and generate logs correctly.
System Testing: Perform end-to-end testing with multiple client accounts to validate the entire process.
6. Maintenance
6.1 Log Review
Logs will be reviewed periodically to ensure the accuracy of test results and identify any issues.
6.2 Script Updates
Test scripts will be updated as needed to accommodate changes in the application under test or the testing requirements.
